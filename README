Sked -- The wikish scheduler
(c) 2006-09 Alexandre Erwin Ittner - alexandre@ittner.com.br


This is an development snapshot and NOT intended for the final user yet.


ABOUT

Sked is a personal calendar that uses a wiki-like syntax for text formatting
and organization. Entries can have topics, links, style formatting, etc.
Unicode is used natively, so, the program can be used with any language.

The wiki code is NOT hidden from the editing interface -- it makes editing
easier and avoids the edit/view/edit cycle. Also text is saved automatically.
A delay is given before the text formatting, so, its appearence will not
change while the user is typing.

The application is written in the Python language, usign the GTK+ toolkit
(with PyGTK and Glade) for the user interface. Although primarily designed
for X desktops (Unix/Linux/*BSD/etc.), the application is portable and will
run on Windows.

Information is stored in a on-disk, flat-file database. To protect user
information and avoid unauthorized access to private/confidential data, the
database is encrypted with AES using 128-bit keys derived from a 
user-provided passphrase through MD5 ("string to key", S2K). GZIP compression
is used to reduce the database size and spoil know-text cryptanalysis. The
PyCrypto library is used for all encryption-related functions.


SECURITY WARNING

The current database implementation leaks a lot of information for
cryptanalisys. Do not trust it yet -- it will keep curious eyes out of your 
notes, but I don't think it will resist to a equipped adversary. The leaked
information includes:

  * The total numbers of database entries;
  * The approximated length of all entries;
  * The modification time of all entries. It is a critical point, since
    "history", "options", etc. will always be the last modified ones, in a
    know order, which may lead to cryptanalytic attacks.

Also, the database wastes disk space due to filesystem clustering.



REQUIREMENTS

  * Python >= 2.4
  * PyGTK+ >= 2.8
  * PyCrypto >= 2.0


TO DO

  * Implement a decent encrypted database;
  * Fix the GUI (better dialogs/windows, toolbars, etc.);
  * Better code organization;
  * Better search system;
  * Printing;
  * HTML exporting;
  * etc.


WIKI SYNTAX TIPS

  === Header 1 ===
  == Header 2 ==
  = Header 3 =

  *bold*
  _underline_
  //italic//
  [[Link]]

  Notes:
    * Dates in the formats DD/MM/YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD reconized automatically.
    * No other text are allowed in the same line as the headers.
