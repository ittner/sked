Sked -- The wikish scheduler - http://wikisked.sourceforge.net/


== About ==

Sked is a personal organizer, calendar, schedule and braindump application
with a wiki-like syntax for text formatting and organization. It is easier
think of it as the result of the merge of a calendar with a desktop wiki.

Sked is designed to optimize your workflow and everything is tailored to speed
up editing operations: links and styles are unobtrusively inferred from the
syntax, entries are automatically saved after a few seconds, almost all
commands have keyboard shortcuts, and the last entries are kept in a history.
Also, the wiki code is *not* hidden from the editing interface -- this makes
editing easier, avoids the create/view/change cycle, and allows you to copy
and paste text among other applications without loss of information. An
user-defined delay is given before the text reformatting, so its appearance
will not change while you are typing.

All entries are stored in a compressed and encrypted Berkeley DB4 database in
your $HOME directory. The encryption aims protect the information even from a
skilled adversary (but I am not a cryptologist and have not done any extensive
analysis of the DB4's crypto implementation -- it is a standard 128 bit AES).
Users wanting a higher security level should use full volume encryption for
the $HOME directory.



== News ==


  * Sked now have keyboard macros for frequently used text fragments. These
    macros are simple word expansions called by pressing Ctrl+Enter with the
    cursor placed just after a macro. The replacement strings may have some
    format tokens for automatic insertion of common data.

= News in version 0.4 =

  * The search system now allows finding entries with names near to a given
    search term.
  * Sked can now export configuration and history to the XML files. It is
    also possible to select what kind of data will be exported or imported.
  * The commands to add formatting codes now toggles the tags in the borders
    of the selection. The commands to add section headers also are a bit
    more clever now, removing other header tags if necessary.
  * When format commands are issued with some text selected, the cursor is
    moved to the end of the selection, and the selection is removed. If no
    text is selected, the cursor is placed between the format tags.
  * It is now possible to follow links by pressing Control+Enter.

= News in version 0.3 =

Sked internals were redesigned in version 0.3, preparing the code for some
new features and interface changes in the future version 0.4. The database
format was also changed, so, please read the section "Installation and upgrade"
before upgrading your existing installation. A summary of the changes include:

  * The local search function is now case-insensitive;
  * Some bugs in the undo/redo command were fixed;
  * The position of the cursor is saved now (thanks Vyacheslav Slobodyan for
    this suggestion);
  * The wiki-code interpreter was improved to prevent misformating;
  * Now it is possible to disable the password protection of the database;
  * A small margin was added to the main text box for better readability;




== System requirements ==

Sked is designed to work in any modern Linux/Unix system, but it also works
in the most recent Windows versions, provided that the following packages
and its dependencies are installed. All they are common place in Linux
systems (except possibly python-Levenshtein) and any inconsistencies are
normally solved automatically by the package manager when Sked is installed
from DEB or RPM packages. The following packages are required:

  * Python >= 2.6
  * PyGTK+ >= 2.10
  * python-Levenshtein >= 0.10.0 is required for the name similarity search.
    It is available in the most popular desktop Linux distributions and in
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein/
  * python-dbus >= 0.83 is required for some usability features (e.g. handle
    several instances gracefully)

Note: Sked may work with Python 2.5.x, but it is necessary to install the
module 'json' manually.




== Installation and upgrade ==

Sked is provided in several formats and the installation procedures varies.
The .tar.gz package works for every supported system, but requires manual
installation -- these archives must be unpacked in the final installation
directory, like /opt/sked/, and you must create your own menu entries. The
installation of Debian packages is simpler: just call them up with "dpkg" or
double-click it to install with your distribution's default package manager.
The installation from RPM packages are similar.

It is also possible to install using the script "setup.py", but it is mainly
intended to generate packages for Linux systems. For instructions, just call
the script with "./setup.py --help".

A special caution is needed when upgrading from a previous version of Sked,
since new versions may bring incompatible changes to the database format. The
best way to ensure a successful upgrade is to export the database as XML and
import it back. The procedure is:

  1. In the menu "File", select "Export..." and give a file name to export
     the current database to a XML file;
  2. Remove the old database (stored in ~/.local/share/sked/sked2.db);
  3. Upgrade Sked;
  4. Open the new version. Sked will create a new database;
  5. In the menu "File", select "Import..." and select the file give in the
     first step.

See "Importing and exporting data" below for more information.



== Usage ==

Once installed, Sked adds a menu entry to the "Applications/Office" in your
desktop environment in any contemporary general purpose Linux distro. If you
have installed Sked manually, you must also create some desktop entry. It also
happens on Windows -- since there is no automatic installation in Windows,
you must create a shortcut somewhere.

When called for the first time, Sked asks a password to encrypt the database.
You may leave it blank if you do not want to protect it; It is possible to
change this later. There is no way to access your data without this password,
so, chose it wisely.

Sked uses a single database per user account per system, i.e., there is no
"Open" or "Close" commands in the interface. You must consider this if you
use several accounts or if several people share one account on the same
computer (this last behavior is more common on Windows). Since centralizing
the information in a single place frees you of wondering in which database
your entries are saved, there is no much sense in not doing this. The
database file is physically stored in the path dictated by "XDG_DATA_HOME",
according to the FreeDesktop Base Directory Specification -- which translates
to "~/.local/share/sked/" if you have not changed it.

Despite the centralized approach to the "default" database, it is possible to
select an alternative database file through the command line (eg.
"sked /some/other/database/file.db"). This is mainly intended to allow
testing, maintenance, and experimentation without risking your real data. You
may, of course, keep several "real" databases and select one of with this
method.  It just happens that Sked was not designed to work this way --
keeping several databases is not much different than keeping a lot of text
files, one of the  problems that Sked was created to solve.



= Basic usage =

Everything in Sked is tailored for speed and agility -- it means automating
whatever is possible and avoiding non-productive operations. When opened,
Sked jumps to "today's page", which usually contains your daily appointments
and links to other pages. The "Index" page is  intended to store your
non-daily links, like any desktop wiki, and can also be accessed through the
"Home" button, the menus or keyboard shortcut (Alt+Home).

It is possible to change pages through the calendar (which creates and jumps
through pages with standardized names in the format YYYY-MM-DD), the menu
"Go", the history, the "Page Name" text field, or through links in the
current page. Following a link to a new page automatically creates that page
with a standard header and a backlink to the current one. References to the
most recently visited pages are kept in the history and it is possible to
use the Back/Forward commands as in a web browser.

All edits are saved automatically when you leave the page and after a few
seconds of inactivity (for the exact values, see "File/Preferences"). Sked
does not format the text until you stop typing for a while, which prevents
possibly awful changes in the text appearance during the typing -- but it
is a configurable behavior, you may adjust or remove the delay in the
preferences.


= Wiki syntax =

Sked wiki dialect is designed for fast typing and good readability as text,
while keeping some similarities with the MediaWiki syntax and the conventions
used in email. The following tokens are recognized:

  === Header 1 ===
  == Header 2 ==
  = Header 3 =

  *bold*
  _underline_
  //italic//
  [[Link]]
  ||| Preformated text |||

  Notes:
    * URLs are parsed intelligently;
    * Dates in the formats DD/MM/YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD recognized automatically;
    * No other text are allowed in the same line as the headers.




= Searching =

Sked have two types of search: Local (for searching text in the current page),
and Global. Local search is simpler and accessible in the menu "Edit/Local
search" or with Ctrl+F. Once open, it will show a search bar in the bottom of
the main window that you can use to navigate among the search results.

The global search commands are located in the side menu and have some extra
options -- it is possible to search for some words, all words, or the exact
phrase in the full text or only in the names of the pages. It is also
possible to search the database for ages with names near to a given search
term, sorting the results by similarity.



= Insert page and templates =

The command "Insert Page" pastes the content of another page into the current
one. It solves the frequent need for a template system for storing blocks of
text common to several pages that share the same structure. Just put the text
in a new page and use this command to insert it in the desired location. The
"Insert Page" dialog box have its own history and will remember the pages
inserted frequently. For smaller pieces of text, check the "Keyboard macros"
bellow.



= Importing and exporting data =

It is possible to export the Sked database to a XML file suitable for backup
and long term storage -- this information may be imported in previous/later
versions of Sked and reused by other applications.

Usually you will export "complete" files (ie. including all pages, history
and configuration options), but is also possible to selectively export only
part of this data -- for example, you may want to export your configuration
and import it in another database, keeping the pages and history intact.

It is also possible to selectively import data, despite the data available
in the exported file. For example, if you have a complete file but only want
to import the pages, ignoring the configuration, just select the file type
"Sked XML, pages only" in the "Import" dialog box: the pages will be imported
and all other data will be ignored.

Since the XML files are NOT encrypted, all data stored will be readable by
anyone with access to the files. You may want to use another encryption
tool before transmitting/storing this files (eg. GnuPG).

Note: Sked versions 0.3 or older can not read the "complete" XML files (with
history and configuration data) used by later versions. To export data to
these versions, it is necessary to select the option "Sked XML, pages only"
in the "Export" dialog box. If you exported a "complete" file by mistake and
need to import it in a older Sked, you may: (1) import the file in a current
version and export it again in the right format or (2) edit the files in a
text editor to remove the new information.



= Keyboard macros =

Keyboard macros are shortcuts for frequently used text fragments. They can
be configured in the "Macros" tab in the preferences window. After set, just
type the name of the macro in the main text field, keep the cursor after it
and press Ctrl+Space; the name will be replaced with the substitute string.
It is possible to create a macro to enter your name and email when you type
your initials, for example.

Sked macros may also have "tokens", ie, small codes which are replaced by
some relevant information upon insertion. There are two kind of these tokens:
text tokens (prefixed by "\") and date tokens (prefixed by "%").  The text
tokens are listed bellow:

    \a  The name of the current page;
    \p  The name of the last page visited, according to the history;
    \P  The same as \p, but automatically formatted as a link if necessary,
        e.g. [[Some page]] or 2010-02-03;
    \c  The contents of the clipboard (only if text);
    \n  A newline character;
    \t  A tab character;
    \\  A literal '\' character.

Date tokens format the current date and time according to the "strftime"
syntax. This format is also used used by several other programs, so, it is
possible that you recognize them. Below follows a list with some of these
tokens -- Please note that this is just an excerpt of the manpage, there are
many other tokens available. Check "strftime(3)" for more information.

    %F  Date in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD), recognized by Sked;
    %x  The current date, as configured in your locale preferences;
    %X  The current time, as configured in your locale preferences;
    %d  The day of the month as a decimal number;
    %m  The month as a decimal number;
    %y  The two-digit year, without the century (eg. 10);
    %Y  The four-digit year, including the century (eg. 2010);
    %H  The hour as a number using a 24-hour clock;
    %I  The hour as a number using a 12-hour clock;
    %M  The minute as a decimal number;
    %S  The second as a decimal number;
    %R  The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M);
    %T  The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S);
    %p  Either 'AM' or 'PM', or the translation for the current locale;
    %n  A newline character;
    %t  A tab character;
    %%  A literal '%' character.

Note that '%n' and '%t' are equivalent to '\n' and '\t' -- many applications
already use one of these syntaxes, so, it makes some sense to support both.

These tokens can, or course, be mixed together. For example, it is possible
to define a macro "Source: \c - Retrieved: %F" to automatically paste URLs
with the access date in your notes. These tokens allows the creation of very
practical (despite initially not obvious) time-saving automations.



= Database security: Encryption =

Sked saves your data in an encrypted Berkeley DB4 database locked with a
password. The encryption aims to protect user information even from a very
skilled adversary. For technical information on this subject, see
http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/env/encrypt.html.

There is no way to access the database without the password. If you forget
it, all your entries will be lost forever! Of course, as the backups are not
encrypted, you may delete the database, create a new one and re-import your
data.



= Database security: Backups =

Every piece of data saved in your computer MUST have a backup, and your Sked
database is no exception. It is possible to backup your database by copying
the database file to the storage medium, but this is a sub-optimal approach:
since the database format is subject to changes between Sked versions, you
may need the exact same version to restore it -- something impractical if you
need to restore a specific entry deleted years ago.

It is better to backup your data by exporting the database as a XML file,
which can be used with any Sked version or even without Sked. For that,
simply export your data in using the format "Sked XML, complete". For more
information on these formats, read "Importing and exporting data" above.



== To Do ==

  * Port the user interface to use GtkActions;
  * A multilingual interface;
  * Better search system;
  * Printing.



== Know bugs ==

  * Find and replace is a no-op;
  * In Windows, the application leaves stray lockfiles in the event of an
    OS crash or power failure. This does not happen in Linux, Mac or other
    Unix systems.
