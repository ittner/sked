Sked -- The wikish scheduler - http://wikisked.sourceforge.net/

ABOUT

Sked is a personal organizer, calendar, schedule and braindump application
with a wiki-like syntax for text formatting and organization. It's easier
think of it as the result of the merge of a calendar with a desktop wiki.

Everything is tailored to speed up editing operations and ease the usage
workflow: links and styles are unobtrusively inferred from the syntax,
entries are automatically saved after a few seconds, almost all commands
have keyboard shortcuts, and the last entries are kept in a history. Also,
the wiki code is not hidden from the editing interface -- this makes editing
easier, avoids the create/view/change cycle, and allows copy and pasting text
among other applications without loss of information. A user-defined delay is
given before the text reformatting, so, its appearance will not change while
the user is typing.

All entries are stored in encrypted Berkeley DB4 database in the user's HOME
directory. The encryption aims protect user information even from a skilled
adversary (but I'm not a cryptologist and haven't done any extensive analysis
of the DB4's crypto implementation -- it is a standard AES 128 bit). Users
wanting a stronger security level should use full volume encryption for the
$HOME directory (as I do).

As an extra, GZIP compression is used to shrink the database size.
