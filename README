Sked -- The wikish scheduler
(c) 2006 Alexandre Erwin Ittner - aittner@netuno.com.br


This is the first public release of Sked. This is a development release only
and NOT intended for the final user.


ABOUT

Sked is a personal calendar/scheduler that uses a wiki-like syntax for text
formatting and organization. Entries can have topics, links, style formatting,
etc. Unicode is used natively, so, the program can be used with any language.

The wiki code is NOT hidden from the editing interface -- it makes editing
easy, and avoids the edit/view/edit cycle. Also, text are saved automatically.
A delay is given before the text formatting, so, its appearence will not
change while the user is typing.

The application is written in the Python language, usign the GTK+ toolkit
(with PyGTK and Glade) for user interface. Although primarily designed for
X11 (Unix/Linux/*BSD/etc.) desktops, the application is portable for Win32
and MacOS systems.

Information is stored in a on-disk, flat-file database. To protect user
information and avoid unauthorized access to private/confidential data, the
database is encrypted with AES, using 128-bit keys derived from a
user-provided passphrase through MD5 ("string to key", S2K).  GZIP compression
is used to reduce the database size and spoil know-text cryptanalysis. The
PyCrypto library is used for all encryption-related functions.


SECURITY WARNING

The current database implementation leaks a lot of useful information for
cryptanalisys. Don't trust it yet! The leaked information includes:

  * The total numbers of database entries;
  * The approximated length of all entries;
  * The modification time of all entries. It's critical since "history", 
    "options", etc. will always be the last modified ones, in a know order,
    which may lead to cryptanalytic attacks.

Also, the database wastes disk space due to clustering.



REQUIREMENTS

  * Python >= 2.4
  * PyGTK+ >= 2.8
  * PyCrypto >= 2.0


TO DO

  * Implement a decent encrypted database.
  * Fix the GUI (better dialogs/windows, toolbars, etc.)
  * Better code organization.
  * Better search system.
  * Printing.
  * HTML exporting.
  * etc.
