Description: A wiki-based personal organizer, calendar, schedule application
  Sked is a personal organizer, calendar, schedule and braindump application
  with a wiki-like syntax for text formatting and organization. It's easier
  think of it as the result of the merge of a calendar with a desktop wiki.
