=== Sked wiki language ===

Sked's wiki dialect is designed for fast typing and good readability as text, while keeping some similarities with the MediaWiki's syntax and the conventions used in email. The following tokens are recognized:


=== Level 1 Header ===

== Level 2 Header ==

= Level 3 Header =

Links pointing to existing pages and [[non-existing pages]] appears different;
Dates written as 20/06/2009 or 2009-06-20 links automatically to the corresponding entry;
URLs are parsed intelligently: www.kernel.org,  http://wikisked.sourceforge.net/ and (try www.google.com);
Text can also be marked as *bold*, //italic// and _underline_;
There are keyboard shortcuts for almost every command;
Styles may be customized;
Everything stills being *text*.

=== Sked database security ===

== Encryption ==

Sked saves your data in an encrypted Berkeley DB4 database locked with a password. The encryption aims to protect user information even from a skilled adversary. For technical information on this subject, see http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/env/encrypt.html.

There is no way to access the database without the password. If you forget it, all your entries will be lost! Of course, as the backups are not encrypted, you may delete the database, create a new one and import the data back. 


== Backups ==

Every piece of data saved in your computer *must* have a backup, and Sked's database is no exception. To backup your data, *do not* simply copy the database file to the storage media -- the right way to backup is export it as XML (menu "File" and "Export") so it can be imported back with the corresponding "Import" command.  

The XML format is suitable for long term archival and can be read even without Sked. But note that this XML file is *not* encrypted -- to keep this data safe you must encrypt it with some other utility, like GnuPG (http://www.gnupg.org/).


== Upgrading ==

Sked database format may change from time to time and some changes may make the database incompatible with the previous format. So, a special caution is needed when upgrading from a previous version of Sked. The best way to ensure a successful upgrade is to export the database as XML *before* the upgrade and import it back after.

== About ==

Sked is a personal organizer, calendar, schedule and braindump application with a wiki-like syntax for text formatting and organization. It is easier think of it as the result of the merge of a calendar with a desktop wiki.

Sked is designed to optimize your workflow and everything is tailored to speed up editing operations: links and styles are unobtrusively inferred from the syntax, entries are automatically saved after a few seconds, almost all commands have keyboard shortcuts, and the last entries are kept in a history. Also, the wiki code is *not* hidden from the editing interface -- this makes editing easier, avoids the create/view/change cycle, and allows your to copy and paste text among other applications without loss of information. An user-defined delay is given before the text reformatting, so its appearance will not change while you are typing.
